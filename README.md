Fedora Loves Python 3D Printable Staffs
=======================================

Those are 3D printable staffs for our [Fedora Loves Python
initiative](https://fedoralovespython.org/). Based on the awesome [Pythonic
Staff of Enlightenment](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1709203) by James
Stewart and [Exploitable Heart](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6190) by
Emmett Lalish.

Currently, no printing guide is provided yet, but we are working on it.
